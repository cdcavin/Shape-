# Shape+

Here you can find all the code for the pitching model I created, called Shape+. The goal of Shape+ is to predict the Expected Run Value (xRV) of a pitch based on its physical characteristicsâ€”such as velocity, spin rate, break, release location, and derived metrics like induced vertical break and approach angles.

This repository contains all the code used to build, validate, and deploy the Shape+ model. The code covers everything from data processing and statistical modeling to visualization. I have also written a detailed Medium article that explains the methodology behind Shape+, which you can read here: https://medium.com/@cade.cavin/shape-v1-0-pitch-modeling-5e2e36418b02.
